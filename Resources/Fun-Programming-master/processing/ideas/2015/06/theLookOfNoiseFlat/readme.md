# theLookOfNoiseFlat

Draws closed shapes by passing the points of a circle through the `noise()` function.

That value is used as the variable radius of circular shape. The radius
decreases over time, so we can draw smaller and smaller shapes as time passes,
with the goal of covering the screen, first with large shapes and at the end
very small ones.

The colors are read from random photographs found in a folder.

Press `z` during the drawing to blur previous shapes, `[space]` to
load a new image for color sampling.
