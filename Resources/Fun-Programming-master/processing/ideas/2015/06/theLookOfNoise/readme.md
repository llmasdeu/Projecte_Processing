# theLookOfNoise

Draws closed shapes either with ADD or SUBTRACT blend modes.
The shape drawn is a circle passed through noise(). Since circles are
closed, whatever comes out of noise is also closed. By including
time in the noise call the shape moves in the screen.

The `z` key zooms in and blurs. Use it for creating depth.
The `a` key sets ADD mode, `o` sets SUBTRACT.
