All cold under the vapors
We spread evil sounds over the dreamscape
Intense! The demon is coming
Totally violet within the earth
We transform tiny cats within the clouds
Damn! The night has vanished
So splintering against the mud
We grind splintering meaning in the dreamscape
Ahhh! The devil will come
open-eyed alive
fading slowly
a sense of danger
To what end
our neighbour
look for landmarks
unable to stop
