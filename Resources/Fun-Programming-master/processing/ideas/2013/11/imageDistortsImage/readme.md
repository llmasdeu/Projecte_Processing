# imageDistortsImage

## Painting program

```
Loads random images from two folders (please configure)
to act as textures for painting strokes.
The brush size modulates with time.

How I use it: I paint a stroke, if I don't like it, press 'u' to undo,
try again. Get into the rhythm. Wait until the stroke paints thin or thick.
Observe. Press [SPACE] to change paint colors. Embrace the unpredictable.

Key shortcuts:
[DELETE] clears the screen
's'      saves image in TIF format
'u'      undo last stroke
[SPACE]  load new random images

Mouse
Left mouse button drag to paint a stroke
Light mouse button drag to paint darker
```
