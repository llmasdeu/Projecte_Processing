# voronoi

Testing the Voronoi class from Toxiclibs.

The program creates a voronoi triangle mesh on every animation frame
based on 20 points moved by the noise() function.

Then it uses the triangles from that mesh to draw translucent lines
and points without clearing the screen which results in a somewhat
organic morphing shape.
