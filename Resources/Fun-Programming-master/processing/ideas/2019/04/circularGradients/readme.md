# circularGradients

Draw a grid of squares covering the window. The color of each square
is chosen randomly from a list of colors.
The squares are shaded with a circular gradient, implemented in a shader.
Then a "tornado" effect is applied to the center of the window, deforming 
the squares.

There's an artifact when curving some lines that I later 
[solved](https://creativecodeberlin.github.io/Stammtisch/2019/05/03/ccs061.html) 
when porting this program to OPENRNDR.
