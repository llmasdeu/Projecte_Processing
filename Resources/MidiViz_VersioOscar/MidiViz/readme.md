# Playing MIDI files in Processing

I wrote this program to play midi files and visualize the channels, notes and velocities.

There are thousands of files online in `.mid` format. I think it's quite an interesting source of data. We often try to get information out of sound using FFT, but that's a very limited approach which doesn't give us the chords and simultaneous notes being played. 

Of course using MIDI has its own limitations. For instance, you don't know if the synths being played have short or long decay, so it can be hard to visualize decaying sounds with precision.

In any case, fun to play with I think.

If you create anything with it, I would be happy if you link it at https://forum.processing.org/two/discussion/comment/116764 for others to see.
